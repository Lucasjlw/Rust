## Introduction
A collection of Rust projects intended to be as low-level as I am capable. This is so that I can 1) learn Rust and 2) learn systems-level programming. Most of these projects are beginner, and I tend to come up with them by simply asking an LLM what I should do. There is an overarching, however: I plan to develop a Rust-based full-stack framework. You can already see the planning of this in the projects I've currently got.
